# Welcome to Kendall's GitHub Page

Hello, my name is Kendall Coughlin and I'm a sophomore at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. I am majoring in Journalism with minors in Marketing, and Communications. I am a tour guide, a reporter for The Brown and White, Vice President of Lehigh University Club Field Hockey team, member of The Marketing Club and Assistant Philanthropy Chair of my sorority, Alpha Omicron Pi. I love to read, write, bake and spend time with family and friends! 


I am hoping to pursue a career in public relations, advertising and marketing. During my time at Lehigh I have found my course work extremely exciting and interesting as it related to the evolving media and world of journalism we live in. This summer I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to travel as an Iacocca Intern to Milan, Italy. This  opportunity is allowing me to apply  my coursework in Journalism, Marketing and Communications at Lehigh to real world situations and gain global experience. I will be spending 7 weeks interning with a company performing tasks in public relations, communications, drafting copy, and using various social media platforms. The Iacocca Internship will provide me the opportunity of a lifetime, with hands-on international experience that I will be able to use in my career.
